### HOW TO WIN / LOSE
There's a timer in the top-right of the screen.
When you kill, it gives you time.
The more powerful the enemy, the more time; 
picking collectible figures give you 5 seconds
You lose if time's over or get killed before!!
(Youg have got 3 lives for each level) 

############### CONTROLS ############### 
It is preferred to use a controller (due to 
a more responsive movement).
